# Magic: The Gathering Deck Builder

This is a web application that allows users to create and save Magic: The Gathering decks. Users can register and sign in to the app to start building decks. The app fetches card data from the Magic: The Gathering API and allows users to add cards to their decks using a simple drag-and-drop interface.

This was a group project I worked on with https://github.com/kristofferbacaling after graduation from Dev Academy Aotearoa.

The objective to this project was to be able to solidify our learning after graduating from Dev Academy by practising the things we had learnt.
We also wanted to stretch ourselves by attempting things we hadn't tried, for example an auto complete form.
